# Ethical Hacking Project: CTFBox-3

## Overview
This project is part of the Ethical Hacking course at Vanier College. It involves conducting a penetration test on the CTFBox-3 system to identify and document security vulnerabilities and threats, with the primary goal of gaining root access to the system.

## Team Members

## Project Summary
The project focuses on a Black Box penetration test aimed at capturing a flag. Key tasks include setting up network configurations, identifying the IP address of the CTFBox-3 Linux machine, and ensuring its connection with Kali Linux. The report details strategies for maintaining access, moving within the network, and covering tracks to gain full control of the target machine.

## Key Findings
- The target machine exhibits a high-risk profile with vulnerabilities posing threats for information theft and unauthorized access.
- Three critical vulnerabilities were discovered: a directory browsing issue, sensitive data exposure in a configure.php.bk file, and a severe privilege escalation flaw.
- Exploitation tactics were employed to gain root control, including directory traversal, brute force techniques, and privilege escalation exploits.

## Recommendations
- Implement input validation, update and patch systems, and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Update to the latest versions of osCommerce, PolicyKit, and Sudo to avoid exploitation.
- Enhance SSH security by restricting root login, changing the default SSH port, and implementing key-based authentication.

## Conclusion
The ethical hacking efforts exposed significant security lapses in the system and provided valuable insights into effective exploitation tactics while maintaining discreet access and control.
